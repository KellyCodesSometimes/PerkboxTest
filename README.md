# Component Structure // Reusability
1. Form Container - Made into a reusable component so that we could keep any form elements on the screen consistent in terms of styling and affect on layout.
2. Input Template - Made into a reusable component for the same reason as the above. This would also allow 'scalability' in the future to expand this component to include optional fields such as information popups to guide the user through a form etc...
3. Job Box - Job box uses the form container to keep styling consistent with other elements on the screen, but has been extracted into its own component as we're going to reuse this logic for each job that we have. By turning this into a reusable component, rather than having to repeat the logic for each job, not only are we following DRY (thus keeping code more maintainable and readable) but also means we could add the option for users to have many more jobs without too much code upkeep.


# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
